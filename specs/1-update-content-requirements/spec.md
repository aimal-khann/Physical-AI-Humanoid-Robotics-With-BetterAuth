# Feature Specification: Advanced Academic Depth for Modules

**Feature Branch**: `1-update-content-requirements`
**Created**: 2025-12-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Update the feature specification to require "Advanced Academic Depth" for all modules. Update the "Content Requirements" section to match the Hackathon Course Details: 1. **Module 1 (ROS 2)**: Must cover Nodes, Topics, Services, and `launch.py` configuration in depth. 2. **Module 2 (Simulation)**: Must compare Physics Engines (ODE vs PhysX) and detail Sensor Simulation. 3. **Module 3 (Isaac)**: Must explain VSLAM, Nav2 behavior trees, and Reinforcement Learning (Isaac Gym). 4. **Module 4 (VLA)**: Must detail the "Voice-to-Action" pipeline and Prompt Engineering for robotics. 5. **Module 5 (Capstone)**: Must provide a full System Architecture diagram and Hardware Requirements (Jetson/RealSense). Success Criteria: Each chapter must be at least 1500 words and include code snippets."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Comprehensive Module Content (Priority: P1)

As a student, I want to find detailed and academically rigorous content for each module, covering all specified topics in depth, so that I can gain a thorough understanding of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

**Why this priority**: Directly addresses the core value proposition of the textbook, ensuring educational quality and completeness.

**Independent Test**: A subject matter expert can review each module to confirm all specified topics are covered comprehensively and with advanced academic depth.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am reviewing Module 1 (ROS 2), **When** I examine its content, **Then** I find detailed explanations of Nodes, Topics, Services, and `launch.py` configuration.
2.  **Given** I am reviewing Module 2 (Simulation), **When** I examine its content, **Then** I find comparisons between ODE and PhysX physics engines and detailed explanations of Sensor Simulation.
3.  **Given** I am reviewing Module 3 (Isaac), **When** I examine its content, **Then** I find explanations of VSLAM, Nav2 behavior trees, and Reinforcement Learning (Isaac Gym).
4.  **Given** I am reviewing Module 4 (VLA), **When** I examine its content, **Then** I find detailed explanations of the "Voice-to-Action" pipeline and Prompt Engineering for robotics.
5.  **Given** I am reviewing Module 5 (Capstone), **When** I examine its content, **Then** I find a full System Architecture diagram and Hardware Requirements (Jetson/RealSense).
