# Introduction

Welcome to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"! This book is your comprehensive guide to understanding and building the next generation of intelligent robots. We bridge the theoretical foundations of Artificial Intelligence with the practical challenges of embodied intelligence, focusing specifically on humanoid robotics.

Throughout these modules, you will learn to leverage cutting-edge technologies and frameworks to create robots that can perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world. From the fundamental communication protocols of ROS 2 to advanced simulation environments, and from the sophisticated AI capabilities of NVIDIA Isaac to the integration of Vision-Language Models, this journey will equip you with the knowledge and skills to contribute to the exciting field of physical AI.
